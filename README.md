🚀 Learning Go (Golang)

Hi there 👋, this repo is where I’m documenting my journey of learning Go (Golang), especially for backend development.

📌 About This Repo

I’m practicing Go basics step by step.

My goal is to build a strong foundation in Go and then move into backend APIs.

Everything here is hands-on practice with examples.

📚 Topics I’m Learning

✅ Arrays → fixed-size collections

✅ Slices → dynamic collections

✅ Maps → key-value pairs (used in headers, configs, etc.)

✅ Structs → custom data containers (basis for APIs)

🔜 JSON with Structs → working with API requests & responses

🔜 HTTP in Go → building real backend APIs

🛠 How to Run the Code

Make sure you have Go installed → Install Go

Clone this repo:

https://github.com/ahmaddii/Backend-with-Golang/tree/main
cd Backend-with-Golang


Run a file:

go run filename.go

🎯 Goals

Build a solid understanding of Go.

Practice backend concepts like APIs, JSON, and HTTP servers.

Eventually build a real-world backend project with Go.
